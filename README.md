# Family Rights Resource Hub

## Purpose
A collaborative, open-source resource hub for same-sex parents, their allies, and legal professionals. This repository serves as a central, evolving collection of legal guides, informational documents, best practices, and community knowledge aimed at supporting families formed through same-sex relationships.

- Provide accessible, accurate, and up‑to‑date legal information for same‑sex parents and prospective parents.
